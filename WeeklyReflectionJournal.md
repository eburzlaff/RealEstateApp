# Weekly Reflection

Documentation of what I did during the weeks in Ent Java and challenges and struggles I faced. 

### Week 1

8/29/22 - 9/4/22

Tasks Completed:
 * Set up VM environment for Ent Java Class
 * Introduced myself to the class
 * Completed quiz about different technologies and terms used in the IT field

Was very anxious about the individual project and did not know what to build. Especially because I did not want to say I was going to build something and later on not deliver it the way I explained it was going to be.

### Week 2

9/5/22 - 9/11/22

Tasks Completed:
 * JDBC Review
 * IntelliJ Debugger
 * Version Control (Git)
 * Created new repository for individual project

Started thinking about ideas of applications I could build for the individual project. Still couldn't decide what to build but laid out possibilities.

### Week 3

9/12/22 - 9/18/22

Tasks Completed:
 * Logging (Log4J)
 * Unit Testing (JUnit)

Learned about Log4J and JUnit, which are technologies that help developers and development teams to be more productive when developing applications. Log4J allows you to log activities in your application and organize them in a separate file. JUnit is a unit testing framework that allows you test different methods to check if the output is as expected.

### Week 4

Tasks Completed:
 * Data Access Objects (DAOs)
 * Hibernate

Learned this new technology called Hibernate, which is an object-relational mapping tool for Java that makes mapping Entities and Attributes of a Database into objects and variables way easier. Had to submit checkpoint 1 this week but still need to catch up with assignments from previous weeks.
  
### Week 5 

Tasks Completed:
 * Implemented one-to-many relationship into my project
 * Added tables that have a one-to-many relationship
 * Added entities to those tables
 * Annotated entities
 * Updated hibernate config file
 * Added generic dao to the project
 * Added unit tests

Learned a lot of things this week. Implementing the generic dao to the project was very helpful and saved me a lot of time.

### Week 6

Tasks Completed:
 * Deployed my Project to AWS Elastic BeanStalk. 
 
 
It was challenging to deploy my application to elastic beanstalk because of all the configuration needed but everything went well.

### Week 7 

Tasks Completed:
 * Implemented aws cognito locally to my project
 * Made AWS cognito to work on Elastic Beanstalk

Learned more about AWS Cognito. Implemented it locally to my project. Did not have a lot of problems making it work but 
it did not work at first because my cognito properties file had a typo in one of the values. Making aws cognito work on elastic beanstalk was very painful because
there was a lot of configuration and steps for it to work. Had to solve a lot of errors regarding configuration.


### Week 8

Tasks Completed:
 * Watched videos regarding consuming an API in Java

Did not accomplish much this week. Watched videos about consuming APIs in Java but couldn't figure out one to use in my project,

### Week 9

Tasks Completed:
 * Watched a video about creating your own API in Java.

This week, I watched a lot of videos about creating your own API in Java. Thought about creating one for my project but decided to focus on other necessary parts of my project.

### Week 10 to 12

Tasks Completed:
 * Focused on the Team project for the Enterprise Java class

Did not accomplish much regarding my project because I had to focus on the team project. I learned a lot of things during this period, especially about git commands that need to be used when working in a team. Also, I learned a lot about creating APIs since our project was a RESTful API with multiple endpoints.

### Week 13

Tasks Completed:
 * Implemented different functionalities into my project

I was behind on the project. I focused on implementing different functionalities into my project when user is logged in. View Profile and Edit Profile functionalities work now.

### Week 14

Tasks Completed:
 * More functionalities

Started working on more functionalities for my project. Tried to make save property functionality work. Had to think about creating a new table for saved properties.

### Week 15

Tasks Completed:
 * Add Properties functionality and save properties functionality
 * Implement an API

I have been trying to make these functionalities work. Decided to create a new table for saved properties that will have a many-to-many relationship with the user table. Will try to implement an API to the project.

### Week 16

Tasks Completed:
 * Finalization of the project

Still need to add images to the properties table and display them in the application. I'm not sure I will have enough time to make it work.

# Weekly Reflection

Documentation of what I did during the weeks in Ent Java and challenges and struggles I faced. 

### Week 1

8/29/22 - 9/4/22

Tasks Completed:
 * Set up VM environment for Ent Java Class
 * Introduced myself to the class
 * Completed quiz about different technologies and terms used in the IT field

Was very anxious about the individual project and did not know what to build. Especially because I did not want to say I was going to build something and later on not deliver it the way I explained it was going to be.

### Week 2

9/5/22 - 9/11/22

Tasks Completed:
 * JDBC Review
 * IntelliJ Debugger
 * Version Control (Git)
 * Created new repository for individual project

Started thinking about ideas of applications I could build for the individual project. Still couldn't decide what to build but laid out possibilities.

### Week 3

9/12/22 - 9/18/22

Tasks Completed:
 * Logging (Log4J)
 * Unit Testing (JUnit)

Learned about Log4J and JUnit, which are technologies that help developers and development teams to be more productive when developing applications. Log4J allows you to log activities in your application and organize them in a separate file. JUnit is a unit testing framework that allows you test different methods to check if the output is as expected.

### Week 4

Tasks Completed:
 * Data Access Objects (DAOs)
 * Hibernate

Learned this new technology called Hibernate, which is an object-relational mapping tool for Java that makes mapping Entities and Attributes of a Database into objects and variables way easier. Had to submit checkpoint 1 this week but still need to catch up with assignments from previous weeks.
  
### Week 5 

Tasks Completed:
 * To be completed
